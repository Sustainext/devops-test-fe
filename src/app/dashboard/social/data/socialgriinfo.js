              The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified
              in Disclosure 408-1, canreflect the reporting organization’s
              approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also drawfrom
              recognized international data sources, such as the ILO Information
              and reports on theapplication of Conventions and Recommendations
              (see reference [1] in the Bibliography).When reporting the
              measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite
              Declarationof Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and
              Social Policy’ and Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and
              Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for MultinationalEnterprises
              for further guidance.In the context of the GRI Standards, a ‘young
              worker’ is defined as a person above theapplicable minimum working
              age and younger than 18 years of age. Note that Disclosure
              408-1does not require quantitative reporting on child labor or the
              number of young workers. Rather, itasks for reporting on the
              operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk
              forincidents of child labor or young workers exposed to hazardous
              work.

              An increase in the number or rate of reported incidents does not
              necessarily mean that there have been a greater number of
              incidents than before; it can indicate an improvement in the
              recording and reporting of incidents. If an increase in the number
              or rate of reported incidents is the result of the organization’s
              actions to improve the reporting and recording of fatalities,
              injuries, and ill health, or its actions to expand the scope of
              its management system to cover more workers or workplaces, the
              reporting organization can explain this and report on these
              actions and their results. Types of work-related injury can
              include death, amputation of a limb, laceration, fracture, hernia,
              burns, loss of consciousness, and paralysis, among others. In the
              context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders
              are covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be
              reported using Disclosure 403-10. If the organization operates in
              a jurisdiction where worker compensation systems classify
              musculoskeletal disorders as injuries, the organization can
              explain this and report these disorders using Disclosure 403-9.
              Injuries involving members of the public as a result of a
              work-related incident are not included in this disclosure, but the
              organization can report this information separately. For example,
              the organization can report incidents where a vehicle driven by a
              worker causes the deaths of other road users or incidents where
              visitors are injured during their visit to the organization’s
              workplace.

              As per the definition of recordable work-related injury, the

              In addition, the organization is required to separately report

              ‘recovery time’, instead of ‘lost time’, as the criterion for
              determining the severity of an injury. Lost time is an indicator
              of the loss of productivity for an organization as a result of a
              work-related injury; it does not necessarily indicate the extent
              of harm suffered by a worker.

              of work-related injuries that resulted in lost-workday cases, the
              average number of lost days per lost-workday case, the number of

              This disclosure covers work-related hazards that pose a risk of
              high-consequence injury if not controlled, even when there are
              control measures in place. The hazards might have been identified
              proactively through risk assessment, or reactively as a result of
              either a high- potential incident or a high-consequence injury.
              Examples of work-related hazards causing or contributing to
              high-consequence injuries include excessive workload demands,
              tripping hazards, or exposure to flammable materials. If the
              identified work-related hazards vary significantly across
              different locations, the organization may group or disaggregate
              these by relevant categories, such as by geographical area or
              business line. Similarly, if there are a high number of hazards,
              the organization may group or categorize them to facilitate
              reporting. When reporting how it has determined which work-
              related hazards pose a risk of high-consequence injury using
              Disclosure 403-9-c-i, the organization can describe the criteria
              or threshold used to determine which hazards pose such a risk and
              which do not. The processes to identify hazards and assess risks,
              and to apply the hierarchy of controls, are reported using
              Disclosure 403-2-a.
              <b>Disclosure 403-9-c-ii</b> does not require reporting which
              work-related hazards have caused or contributed to which
              high-consequence injuries during the reporting period; it requires
              the aggregate analysis of all work- related hazards that resulted
              in high-consequence injuries. If a work-related incident resulting
              in a high-consequence injury is still under investigation at the
              end of the reporting period, the organization can state this in
              the report. The organization can report on actions taken during
              the reporting period to eliminate hazards and minimize risks that
              were identified, or to address work- related incidents that took
              place, in prior reporting periods.

              injuries and its relationship to the ILO code of practice. If the

              (e.g., because the workers performed non-routine work during an

              particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment’.
              Some groups might be at increased risk of work-related injury due
              to demographic factors such as sex, gender, migrant status, or
              age; it can thus be beneficial to break down data on work-related
              injuries by these demographic criteria. ILO Convention 143
              ‘Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention’ defines
              ‘migrant worker’ as ‘a person who migrates or who has migrated

              injury (e.g., amputation, paralysis) or incident (e.g., explosion,

              Clause 2.1.3 requires the organization to include injuries as a

              been organized by the organization (e.g., company or contracted
              bus or vehicle). The organization can report other commuting

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Clause 2.1.4 requires the organization to calculate the rates
              based on either 200,000 or 1,000,000 hours worked. Standardized
              rates allow for meaningful comparisons of statistics, for example
              between different periods or organizations, or help account for
              differences in the number of workers in the reference group and
              the number of hours worked by them. A rate based on 200,000 hours
              worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 100
              full-time workers over a one-year timeframe, based on the
              assumption that one full-time worker works 2,000 hours per year.
              For example, a rate of 1.0 means that, on average, there is one
              work-related injury for every group of 100 full-time workers over
              a one-year timeframe. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked
              indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-time
              workers over a one-year timeframe. A rate based on 200,000 hours
              worked might be more suitable for small organizations. In addition
              to standardized rates, this disclosure requires the organization
              to report absolute data (i.e., numbers), to allow information
              users to calculate the rates themselves using other methodologies
              if needed.

            When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 403-10, the reporting
organization shall include fatalities as a result of work-related ill health in the calculation of the number of cases of recordable work-related ill health.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
            Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or practices. They include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (e.g., noise-induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (e.g., anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder).
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
            This disclosure covers, but is not limited to, the diseases included in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases. In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be reported using this disclosure. See references 5 and 16 in the References section.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
            This disclosure covers all cases of work-related ill health notified to the reporting organization or identified by the organization through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The organization might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected workers, compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected during the reporting period among former workers. If the organization determines, for example through investigation, that the notified case of work-related ill health is not due to exposure whilst working for the organization, it can explain this in the report.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
            This disclosure covers both short-latency and long- latency work-related ill health. Latency refers to the time period between exposure and the onset of ill health.
Many cases of long-latency work-related ill health go undetected; if detected, they might not necessarily be due to exposures with one employer. For example, a worker might be exposed to asbestos while working for different employers over time, or might suffer from a long-latency disease that turns fatal many years after the worker has left the organization. For this reason, data on work-related ill health are to be complemented with information on work-related hazards.
In some situations, an organization might not be able to collect or publicly disclose data on work-related ill health. The following are examples of these situations:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
              National or regional regulations, contractual obligations, health insurance provisions, and other legal requirements related to the privacy of workers’ health-related information, might prevent organizations from collecting, maintaining, and publicly reporting these data.
              </li>

              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
              The nature of information on workers’ exposure to psychosocial factors, largely based on self-disclosure and in many instances protected under healthcare privacy regulations, might limit organizations in disclosing this information.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
            In these situations, the organization is required to provide a reason for omission of these data as set out in GRI 101: Foundation. See clause 3.2 in GRI 101 for requirements on reasons for omission.
Cases of ill health involving members of the public as a result of a work-related incident are not included in this disclosure, but the organization can report this information separately. An example of such an incident is when a chemical substance spill causes ill health among members of a nearby community.
