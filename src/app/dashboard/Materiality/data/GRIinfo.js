              material topics. The process of determining material topics is
              reported under Disclosure 3-1 in this Standard. The organization
              is required to include the material topics listed under this
              disclosure in the GRI content index. If the organization has

              This disclosure requires information on how the organization has

              reported under Disclosure 3-2 in this Standard. The organization
              is required to use the applicable GRI Sector Standards when
              determining its material topics. If any of the topics that are
              included in the applicable Sector Standards have been determined
              by the organization as not material, the organization is required

              absence of applicable Sector Standards, the organization should
              explain how it has considered impacts commonly associated with its
              sectors, and whether any of these impacts have been determined as
              not material, together with an explanation for why this is the
              case. The organization should also explain how it has considered
              impacts commonly associated with its products and geographic
              locations. See section 1 in this Standard and the Sector Standards
              for guidance on impacts commonly associated with sectors,
              products, and geographic locations.

              The organization should describe the methods used to identify its
              impacts, for example,economic, environmental, social, and human
              rights impact assessments, grievance mechanisms, or using
              information from external sources, such as civil society
              organizations. The organization should describe the sources and
              the evidence it has used to identify the impacts. The organization
              should also describe the scope it has defined when identifying the
              impacts, for example, whether it has identified short-term as well
              as long-term impacts. The organization should also describe any
              limitations or exclusions, for example, whether it has excluded
              business relationships from certain parts of its value chain when
              identifying the impacts. Disclosure 2-12 in GRI 2: General
              Disclosures 2021 requires information on the role of the highest
              governance body in overseeing the organization’s due diligence and
              other processes to identify its impacts on the economy,
              environment, and people.

              significance of the impacts, including any assumptions and
              subjective judgments it has made. The significance of an actual
              negative impact is determined by the severity of the impact
              (scale, scope, and irremediable character), while the significance
              of a potential negative impact is determined by the severity and
              likelihood of the impact. In the case of potential negative
              humanrights impacts, the severity of the impact takes precedence
              over its likelihood. The significance of an actual positive impact
              is determined by the scale and scope of the impact, while the
              significance of a potential positive impact is determined by its
              scale and scope as well as its likelihood. See section 1 in this
              Standard for more guidance on assessing the significance of
              impacts. The organization should explain if it has used a
              different approach to prioritize its impacts, for example, if it
              has prioritized potential negative environmental impacts based on
              severity only.

              The organization should also describe how it has defined the

              and whether it has tested its selection of material topics with
              potential information users and experts. The organization is
              required to report whether the highest governance body is
              responsible for reviewing and approving the reported information,
              including the organization’s material topics, under Disclosure
              2-14 in GRI 2. The organization should explain any changes to its
              initial selection of material topics following internal approval
              and testing with potential information users and experts. For
              transparency, the organization can provide a visual representation
              of the prioritization that shows the initial list of topics it has
              identified and the threshold it has set for reporting.

              disclosure. The organization can report the information once and

              For example, if the organization has identified that its
              activities at specific sites could cause water pollution, it
              should describe the types of activities carried out at these sites
              and the geographic location of these sites. Or, if the
              organization has identified that it is directly linked to child
              labor by the business relationships in its supply chain, it should
              specify the types of suppliers using child labor (e.g.,
              sub-contractors doing embroidery work for the organization’s
              products) and the geographic location of these suppliers.

              The organization can provide additional contextual information for
              understanding the extent of its impacts. Adding to the previous
              examples, the organization can report how many of its sites could
              cause water pollution (e.g., 60% of sites, five out of 12 sites)
              or the proportion of production these sites represent, or it can
              report the estimated number of sub-contractors using child labor
              that do embroidery work for the organization

              The organization can explain, for example, whether and how
              affected stakeholders have been involved in determining an
              appropriate remedy for a negative impact or how stakeholder
              feedback is used to assess the effectiveness of the actions take.
