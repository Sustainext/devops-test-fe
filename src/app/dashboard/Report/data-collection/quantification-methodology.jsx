            The process of identifying GHG emission sources is the first step
            involved in the quantification of GHG emissions. The GHG sources are
            then classified following the GHG Protocol – Corporate Standard.
            This is followed by gathering accurate activity data. Selection of
            nationally or internationally accepted emission factors is a crucial
            step and these are available through DEFRA, IPCC and National GHG
            Inventories for the calculation of GHG emissions.{" "}

            (Organization’s name) (Year) GHG inventory is based on the activity
            data and the use of appropriate emission factors to arrive at a
