            GHG accounting and reporting practices are constantly evolving
            alongside advancements in the science of climate change. The GHG
            Protocol and ISO 14064 standards advise that GHG emissions
            inventories be carried out in accordance with the following
            principles:
          </p>
          <p className="text-left mb-4 ">
            <b className="mr-2">RELEVANCE:</b> For an organization’s GHG
            emissions inventory to contain information that users might need for
            making “informed” decisions. Accordingly, The organization has identified the
            appropriate boundaries that reflect its business operations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-left mb-4">
            <b className="mr-2">COMPLETENESS:</b> All relevant emission sources
            within the chosen inventory boundary have been accounted for in the
            GHG inventory so that a comprehensive and meaningful inventory of
            total emissions is compiled.
          </p>
          <p className="text-left mb-4">
            <b className="mr-2">CONSISTENCY:</b> The GHG inventory has been
            compiled in a manner that ensures that the overall emissions
            estimates are consistent and comparable over time.

            <b className="mr-2">TRANSPARENCY:</b> All
            necessary information has been recorded, compiled, and analyzed in a
            manner that enables internal reviewers and external verifiers to
            attest to its credibility.{" "}

            precise to enable us to make decisions with reasonable assurance and
            the reported information is credible. Uncertainties in measurements,
            recording, and calculations have been reduced as far as possible and
